/*
 * MiscUtils.kt
 *
 * This file provides miscellaneous utility functions and configurations used throughout the application.
 *
 * General Purpose:
 * - To define reusable components that simplify common operations in the Ktor application.
 * - To consolidate shared configurations and functionalities, improving consistency and reducing duplication.
 *
 * Features:
 * - **Health Check Utility**: Provides a lightweight endpoint helper for health monitoring.
 *   - Simplifies creating a basic health check endpoint returning a "UP" status.
 * - **JSON Configuration**: Offers a centralized configuration for JSON serialization/deserialization, ensuring consistent behavior across the application.
 *   - Includes advanced features like pretty printing, lenient parsing, and unknown key ignoring.
 *
 * Extensibility:
 * - Additional utilities can be added to this file for functionalities that are reused across multiple files or modules.
 * - The `JsonConfig` object can be extended or modified to adjust global serialization behavior for the application.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * - `healthCheck()`: Use it in a Ktor route to return a "UP" status for health monitoring systems or testing.
 * - `JsonConfig.json`: Configure JSON serialization using the predefined settings across the application.

/**
 * Handles the health check response for the Ktor application.
 *
 * This utility is designed for health monitoring systems to verify whether the application is running
 * and responding as expected. When invoked, it sends a predefined "UP" status and an HTTP 200 (OK) response.
 *
 * ### Features:
 * - Returns a simple JSON object with a status key: `"status": "UP"`.
 * - Responds with `HttpStatusCode.OK` (HTTP 200) to indicate application health.
 *
 * ### Extensibility:
 * - Can be extended to include additional health metrics, such as database connectivity or service integration status.
 *   Example:
 *   ```kotlin
 *   suspend fun ApplicationCall.healthCheck() {
 *       val response = mapOf(
 *           "status" to "UP",
 *           "database" to checkDatabaseStatus() // Custom function to check the database health.
 *       )
 *       respond(HttpStatusCode.OK, response)
 *   }
 *   ```
 *
 * ### Usage Example:
 * Include in a Ktor route to provide health check monitoring:
 * ```kotlin
 * routing {
 *     get("/health") {
 *         call.healthCheck()
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Return Value:
 * Responds to the client with a JSON object indicating the application's health status.
 *
 * @receiver ApplicationCall The Ktor application call context where the response is sent.

suspend fun ApplicationCall.healthCheck() {

/**
 * Provides a centralized configuration for JSON serialization and deserialization.
 *
 * This object defines the default settings for Kotlinx Serialization used in the application. It ensures
 * that all JSON-related operations within the application follow a consistent configuration, simplifying
 * debugging and guaranteeing uniform serialization/deserialization behavior.
 *
 * ### Features:
 * - **Pretty Print**: Formats JSON for readability during development or debugging.
 * - **Lenient Parsing**: Allows parsing JSON with minor structural issues, such as mismatched quotes or extra commas.
 * - **Unknown Key Ignoring**: Prevents errors during deserialization when encountering extra keys that arenâ€™t part of the data model.
 *
 * ### Extensibility:
 * - Additional configuration options can be added as required. For example, you could include stricter validations
 *   or custom serializers to handle specific data types.
 * - Extend the `JsonConfig` object when using it as a base for more specialized JSON configurations in specific modules:
 *   ```kotlin
 *   val customJson = Json(JsonConfig.json) {
 *       encodeDefaults = false // Custom configuration
 *   }
 *   ```
 *
 * ### Usage Example:
 * Use this configuration for serialization and deserialization tasks:
 * ```kotlin
 * val json = JsonConfig.json
 * val jsonString = json.encodeToString(dataObject)
 * val parsedObject = json.decodeFromString<MyData>(jsonString)
 * ```
 *
 * ### Benefits:
 * - Having a single source of truth for JSON behavior enhances maintainability.
 * - Ensures predictable and consistent JSON handling across different parts of the application.
 *
